## Endless Pun ##
  > For those who like puns or just need a laugh

## Summary ##
  > The Pun Generator is a web app that generates a pun from a list of deliberately picked high quality (or very bad) puns. The puns are displayed in a Question and Answer format. The user must click on a button to reveal the answer, so that suspense is built trying to guess the answer.

  >Future features include a mandatory wait time before revealing the answer, a smarter algorithm so that no pun is generated more than once, and the option for users to create accounts and submit their own puns for review.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  > It's normal to encounter awkward situations where there's nothing to talk about. Or maybe you just want to laugh, but no one has good jokes.

  >Enter Pun Generator

## Solution ##
  > Pun Generator contains puns that have been tested to ensure it provides optimal laughter. Puns that have had no effect on the target audience during experimentation do not make it to the list.
  > These puns are so bad, they are guaranteed to make you mad at the creator, or you get your money back.

## Quote from our spokesperson ##

## How to Get Started ##
  > When you first open the app, you will already have a question displayed to you.
  > You click the reveal button to reveal the answer.
  > Or if you are not interested in viewing the answer, you can click on the next pun button to load the next pun.

## Customer Quote ##
